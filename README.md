# Final_Project
Hangman Game
by Vivienne Ho and Adrian Serrano

This game was created to be our final project in out EECE2140: Computing Fundamentals for Engineers class.
We wanted to create a fully functional game of Hangman using Object Oriented Programming in Command Line Interface.
We built this in Python 3 on Spyder, and we used the random library.

Installation:
Download the "hangman_proj.py" file onto you computer and run it through a Python installer, such as Spyder. Run the code and 
you will be able to play the game in the command line.
